# DATA_512_Final_Project
Final Project for UW course DATA 512

This repository will host the documentation for my final project for UW course DATA 512. 

Currently the repository contains a detailed project plan. The project will gather daily summary weather data from NOAA for weather in the Seattle area and analyze changes over time. The final project plan document contains information about how to access the data. 

The code and documentation are under the MIT license.
