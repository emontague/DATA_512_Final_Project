  This project analyses historical Seattle weather. The indicators of climate change were considered on a local level. The data were obtained from the NOAA global daily summaries. The aspects considered were changes in minimum daily temperature, maximum daily temperature, rain fall, and snow fall. There appears to be some evidence of change, but the trends should be investigated more fully. This research project does not attempt to forecast the weather changes.    

#### Research Questions:
1. How has Seattle’s temperature changed over time?
2. What are the seasonal trends in Seattle's daily temperatures? How have they changed?
3. How often does Seattle get snow? Have the number of occurrences changed over time?
4. How much rain does Seattle get? Has the amount changed over time?
